## ✨ The Opportunity  
Zurich is a vibrant city that balances daily life, infrastructure, and major events. But **traffic jams, construction sites, and large festivals** often create bottlenecks and stress for citizens, visitors, and city managers.  

With the help of **satellite data, geospatial insights, and open city data**, we can design smarter tools that make Zurich easier to navigate, more resilient to disruptions, and better planned for the future.  

---

## 💡 The Challenge  
Use **satellite, urban, and mobility data** to create innovative solutions that:  
- Predict and visualize **traffic flows** during construction or festivals  
- Provide **real-time navigation support** for citizens and visitors  
- Help **city planners test scenarios** for new roads, bike lanes, or public transport routes  
- Suggest **alternative mobility options** (walking routes, trams, bikes) when roads are congested  
- Improve **festival and event planning**, ensuring smooth crowd movement and safety  

---

## 🚀 Example Ideas  
- A **festival navigation app** that combines live mobility data, satellite imagery, and open transport schedules to guide visitors around crowded spots  
- An **urban planning dashboard** that simulates traffic flow changes if a bridge or road is closed for construction  
- A **heatmap of city congestion** combining satellite views (Sentinel, Copernicus) with Zurich open data  
- A **mobility recommendation engine** suggesting the best transport option based on weather, traffic, and events

## 🛠️ Suggested Resources  

### 🔹 Data Sources  
- **Open Data Zurich** → [data.stadt-zuerich.ch](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch) (mobility, events, construction zones)  
- **SBB & opentransportdata.swiss** → [opentransportdata.swiss](https://opentransportdata.swiss) (public transport, real-time crowding)  
- **Swisstopo & map.geo.admin.ch** → Swiss geospatial maps & infrastructure  
- **Copernicus / Sentinel** → [scihub.copernicus.eu](https://scihub.copernicus.eu) (satellite imagery for urban monitoring, land use, air quality)  
- **Google Maps APIs / OpenStreetMap** → for routing and navigation layers  

### 🔹 Tools  
- **QGIS** (open-source GIS analysis)  
- **Google Earth Engine** for satellite data processing  
- **Python** (scikit-learn, NetworkX) for traffic and mobility modeling  
- **Leaflet.js / Mapbox** for interactive navigation maps
