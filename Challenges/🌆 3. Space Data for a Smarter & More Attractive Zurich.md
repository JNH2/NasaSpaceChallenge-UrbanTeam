## ✨ The Opportunity

Zurich is one of the world’s most livable cities — but how can we make it even more attractive and accessible for residents and visitors while ensuring sustainable growth?

**Space and geospatial data** (from satellites, remote sensing, and Earth observation) offer unique opportunities to improve tourism experiences, urban planning, and sustainability.

---

## 💡 The Challenge

Use space data and geospatial insights to design solutions that:

- Enhance tourist experiences (e.g., interactive maps, crowd flow guidance, scenic route suggestions)  
- Improve city accessibility (for families, seniors, or people with disabilities)  
- Support sustainable tourism by balancing visitor flows across attractions  
- Optimize urban spaces — from public parks to waterfronts — using data-driven planning

## 🛠️ Suggested Resources

### 🔹 Space & Earth Observation Data

- **[Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)** – Sentinel satellite imagery (land use, air quality, urban changes)  
- **[ESA Urban Thematic Exploitation Platform (U-TEP)](https://urban-tep.eu/)** – Urban space applications & tools  
- **[NASA EarthData](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/)** – Global Earth observation datasets  

### 🔹 Zurich & Swiss Data

- **[Open Data Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/)** – Local mobility, events, environment, demographics  
- **[map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch)** – Swiss topographic and geospatial infrastructure data (swisstopo)  
- **[SBB Open Transport Data](https://opentransportdata.swiss/)** – Public transport schedules, occupancy, real-time updates  

### 🔹 Tools

- **[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)** – Satellite data analysis  
- **[QGIS](https://qgis.org/)** – Open-source GIS software  
- **[Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)** / **[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)** / **[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)** – Build interactive maps

## 🚀 What You Can Build

- **Smart tourism apps** – Suggest hidden gems & distribute visitor flows beyond hotspots  
- **Sustainability dashboards** – Show the environmental impact of tourism (e.g., CO₂ footprint, air quality, green space usage)  
- **Augmented maps** – Overlay real-time satellite data with city data for tourists  
- **Crowd & mobility planners** – Suggest optimal visiting times/routes to avoid crowds
