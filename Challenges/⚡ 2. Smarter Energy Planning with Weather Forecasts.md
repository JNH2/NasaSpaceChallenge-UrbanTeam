# ⚡ 2. Challenge: Smarter Energy Planning with Weather Forecasts

## ⚡ The Problem
Energy balancing groups face a tough task: matching electricity supply with demand in real time. Weather patterns strongly influence both sides of the equation:

- **Generation:** Solar and wind outputs vary with sunshine, wind speeds, and cloud cover.  
- **Consumption:** Temperature, humidity, and seasonal shifts drive heating and cooling needs.

## 💡 The Challenge
Build innovative tools that integrate weather and meteorological forecasts into energy planning to:

- Predict short- and medium-term electricity consumption more accurately.  
- Anticipate demand spikes during cold snaps or heatwaves.  
- Reduce costly balancing energy and improve grid stability.  
- Support Switzerland’s clean energy transition.  

## 🔎 Guiding Questions
- How can we use weather data to forecast consumption at the grid or local level?  
- Can probabilistic forecasts (uncertainty ranges) help operators plan better?  
- How do microclimates in Swiss regions (mountains, lakes, cities) affect demand?  
- Can we combine renewable production forecasts with consumption insights into one model?  


## 🛠️ Suggested Resources (Switzerland & Open Data)

### 🔹 Weather & Climate Data
- [MeteoSwiss Open Data](https://opendata.swiss) – Hourly/daily weather observations, forecasts, climate records  
- [MeteoSwiss API (MeteoSchweiz API)](https://opendata.swiss) – Real-time and forecast weather data  
- [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) – European reanalysis, seasonal forecasts, ERA5 datasets  

### 🔹 Energy Data
- [Swissgrid Transparency Platform](https://transparency.swissgrid.ch) – Load, production, and balancing data for Switzerland’s grid  
- [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu) – Cross-border load, generation, and balancing data  

### 🔹 Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Prophet` – Forecasting & ML models  
- [Open Energy Platform](https://openenergy-platform.org) – Energy datasets & ontologies  
- [pvlib-python](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io) – Solar power modeling based on weather forecasts  


## 🚀 What You Can Build
- An AI model that predicts **hourly Swiss electricity demand** from weather data  
- A **dashboard** combining forecasted demand & renewable generation to show balancing needs  
- A **probabilistic tool** that highlights confidence intervals for planners  
- A local **“energy weather forecast” service** for cities or cantons
