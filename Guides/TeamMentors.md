# 🧭 Team Mentor Guide: NASA Space Apps Zurich 2025

Welcome and thank you for supporting the **NASA Space Apps Challenge Zurich 2025** as a **Team Mentor**!

Mentors play a vital role in guiding teams through the hackathon weekend, helping them stay focused, refine ideas, and get unstuck. You’re the team’s sounding board and supporter – not their developer or leader.

- 🧭 Assigned to 1–3 teams for the full weekend
- 🧑‍🏫 Provide **3 formal checkpoints** with each team (15 mins each)
- 📝 Track team progress & share short notes with organizers
- 🙅 You are **not part of the team** or the submission
- 💡 Provide feedback on feasibility, design, tech direction, or storytelling

> ⚠️ If you’re a **domain or technical expert** and want to co-create a project, you must be added as a team member and **cannot** be their assigned team mentor.

---

## 🗓️ How the Checkpoints Work

Each team must attend 3 mandatory checkpoints during the hackathon. These checkpoints are **15-minute scheduled sessions**, where you meet your assigned teams to:
